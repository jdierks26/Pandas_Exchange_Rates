# Pandas_Exchange_Rates
In this project, I will be using the pandas module to create a simple currency converter and fetcher. This project is my Final for my IST320 class, Fundamentals of Software Development.

Here is the prompt:
Exchange Rates The text file Exchrate.txt gives information about the
currencies of 49 major countries. Each line of the file gives the name of a country, the name of its currency, and
the number of units of the currency that were equal to one American dollar. For instance, one American dollar is equal to
591.4077 Chilean pesos. Use the text file Exchrate.txt in parts (a), (b), and (c).
The text file gives the exchange rates in September 2014.

a. Write a program that requests the name of a county as input and then
displays the name of its currency and its exchange rate.

b. Write a program that displays the names of the countries in ascending order
determined by the number of units that can be purchased for one American
dollar. Figure 5.53 shows the first three countries displayed.

c. Write a program that requests the names of two countries and an amount of
money, and then converts the amount from the first country’s currency to
the equivalent amount in the second country’s currency.
